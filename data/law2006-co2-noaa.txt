# Description_Notes_and_Keywords
#   Description: Law Dome ice core (DSS, DE08 and DE08-2), firn air (DSSW20K), and Cape Grim instrumental (deseasonalised archive, insitu and flask) records of CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations for the past 2000 years. Law Dome location: The dome summit is as follows, individual cores are within about 25 km (see publications): 66°44'S, 112°50'E, 1390m elevation. 
#
# Measurement precision for the ice core air samples is 4.1 ppb CH4, 1.1 ppm CO2, and 6.5 ppb N2O. Measurement precision for the firn air samples is 2 ppb CH4, 0.1 ppm CO2 and 0.3 ppb N2O. Ice core concentrations are adjusted for small system enhancements (1.1 ± 0.8 ppm for CO2, 4.1 ± 4.0 ppb for CH4, and 1.8 ± 0.9 ppb for N2O) as described in MacFarling Meure et al. (2006) and for the effects of gravitational fractionation, also small, as described in Etheridge et al. 1996, 1998. 
#
# Air age spread is 10-12 years for DE08/-2 ice samples, 18-20 years for DSS ice samples and 5 years for DSSW20K firn air samples. See Trudinger et al., 2002 for statistical definitions. DE08 and DE08-2 ice core air dating uncertainty is less than +/- 3 years. DSS ice core air dating uncertainty is less than +/- 5 years. DSS ice dating has been revised based on new accumulation rates and temperatures (van Ommen, T., V. Morgan and M.A.J. Curran. 2004. Deglacial and Holocene changes in accumulation at Law Dome, East Antarctica, Annals Glaciol., 39, 359-365.; MacFarling Meure 2004). The dating of published DSS concentrations have been adjusted by less than 5 years under the new chronology.

#   Abstract: New measurements of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations in ice from Law Dome, Antarctica reproduce published Law Dome CO2 and CH4 records, extend them back to 2000 years BP, and include N2O. They have very high air age resolution, data density and measurement precision. Firn air measurements span the past 65 years and overlap with the ice core and direct atmospheric observations. Major increases in CO2, CH4 and N2O concentrations during the past 200 years followed a period of relative stability beforehand. Decadal variations during the industrial period include the stabilization of CO2 and slowing of CH4 and N2O growth in the 1940s and 1950s. Variations of up to 10 ppm CO2, 40 ppb CH4 and 10 ppb N2O occurred throughout the preindustrial period.  Methane concentrations grew by 100 ppb from AD 0 to 1800, possibly due to early anthropogenic emissions.

#   Abstract:A record of atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios from 1006 A.D. to 1978 A.D. has been produced by analysing the air enclosed in three ice cores from Law Dome, Antarctica. The enclosed air has unparalleled age resolution and extends into recent decades, because of the high rate of snow accumulation at the ice core sites. The CO2 data overlap with the record from direct atmospheric measurements for up to 20 years. The effects of diffusion in the firn on the CO2 mixing ratio and age of the ice core air were determined by analyzing air sampled from the surface down to the bubble close-off depth. The uncertainty of the ice core CO2 mixing ratios is 1.2 ppm (1 σ). Preindustrial CO2 mixing ratios were in the range 275–284 ppm, with the lower levels during 1550–1800 A.D., probably as a result of colder global climate. Natural CO2 variations of this magnitude make it inappropriate to refer to a single preindustrial CO2 level. Major CO2 growth occurred over the industrial period except during 1935–1945 A.D. when CO2 mixing ratios stabilized or decreased slightly, probably as a result of natural variations of the carbon cycle on a decadal timescale.

#   Abstract:Atmospheric methane mixing ratios from 1000 A.D. to present are measured in three Antarctic ice cores, two Greenland ice cores, the Antarctic firn layer, and archived air from Tasmania, Australia. The record is unified by using the same measurement procedure and calibration scale for all samples and by ensuring high age resolution and accuracy of the ice core and firn air. In this way, methane mixing ratios, growth rates, and interpolar differences are accurately determined. From 1000 to 1800 A.D. the global mean methane mixing ratio averaged 695 ppb and varied about 40 ppb, contemporaneous with climatic variations. Interpolar (N-S) differences varied between 24 and 58 ppb. The industrial period is marked by high methane growth rates from 1945 to 1990, peaking at about 17 ppb yr−1 in 1981 and decreasing significantly since. We calculate an average total methane source of 250 Tg yr−1 for 1000–1800 A.D., reaching near stabilization at about 560 Tg yr−1 in the 1980s and 1990s. The isotopic ratio, δ13CH4, measured in the archived air and firn air, increased since 1978 but the rate of increase slowed in the mid-1980s. The combined CH4 and δ13CH4 trends support the stabilization of the total CH4 source.

#   Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the atmospheric concentrations of radiatively important greenhouse gases, including methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon monoxide (CO), have significantly increased during the past 200 years due to anthropogenic emissions.  Analysis of air trapped in polar ice cores allows for past atmospheric variations due to natural climate conditions to be investigated, placing recent changes in a historical context.  In this thesis new high-precision, multispecies measurements of atmospheric trace gas concentrations during the Holocene have been produced by analysing the air trapped in the ice at Law Dome, East Antarctica (66°46’08”E, 112°48’28”S).  The ice core records are well-dated, have high age resolution and overlap with modern instrumental records due to the high accumulation rate at the drilling sites.  The combination of high age resolution, precise dating and high precision measurements allows for subtle, decadal-scale variability to be detected.  The multispecies measurement technique allows for biogeochemical causes of variations to be identified.  The first part of this study focused on the late Holocene period (AD 0 to 1975).  New high-precision records of CH4, CO2, N2O and CO have been produced for this period.  The CH4 and CO2 measurements are used to build upon the existing Law Dome records of these gases during the last 1000 years, to validate and further define previously observed variations.  The new measurements extend the records of these gases by another 1000 years.  As a consequence of the multispecies measurement technique it has been possible to also measure N2O and CO during this period.  These new measurements highlight the atmospheric response to the Little Ice Age (LIA) cooling (AD 1550 to 1800), particularly a 10 ppm decrease in atmospheric CO2 between AD 1550 and 1600.  A stabilization of CO2 during the 1940s was also confirmed in the Law Dome record.  Increased data density during this period shows that the atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio stabilized at ~310 ppm between 1937 and 1955.  New signals were observed in the extended records, including a 100 ppb increase in the CH4 concentration between AD 0 and 1800, which is probably the result of increasing pre-industrial anthropogenic emissions.  The second part of this study focussed on the CO2 and CH4 response to a rapid, abrupt cooling at 8,200 years BP.  The Law Dome (DSS) measurements are complemented by four measurements of NorthGRIP (Greenland) ice core.  A decrease of at least 52 ppb CH4 is observed in the DSS record, and a decrease of at least 62 ppb is observed at NorthGRIP during the same period.  A smaller CO2 response of 4 to 5 ppm is seen in both the records.  The CH4 signal is used to improve the chronologies of these ice cores by synchronising with other well-dated CH4 records, specifically GRIP (Greenland) and Dome C (Antarctica).

#   Abstract: We report a 2000-year Antarctic ice-core record of stable carbon isotope measurements in atmospheric methane (δ13CH4). Large δ13CH4 variations indicate that the methane budget varied unexpectedly during the late preindustrial Holocene (circa 0 to 1700 A.D.). During the first thousand years (0 to 1000 A.D.), δ13CH4 was at least 2 per mil enriched compared to expected values, and during the following 700 years, an about 2 per mil depletion occurred. Our modeled methane source partitioning implies that biomass burning emissions were high from 0 to 1000 A.D. but reduced by almost ∼40% over the next 700 years. We suggest that both human activities and natural climate change influenced preindustrial biomass burning emissions and that these emissions have been previously understated in late preindustrial Holocene methane budget research.

#   Abstract: This paper investigates the use of a numerical model of firn diffusion and bubble trapping in the reconstruction of atmospheric records from firn measurements. We describe the concept of mean age and effective age of tracers in firn air and how the growth rate of a tracer in the atmosphere can alter the effective age. We discuss an iterative method to assign effective ages to firn measurements for tracers with fairly simple atmospheric histories, taking into account atmospheric growth rate variations. We then develop a Bayesian synthesis inversion calculation for inverting firn concentration measurements. This calculation gives estimates of the atmospheric concentration record with uncertainties. The dating and inversion techniques are demonstrated here with carbon tetrachloride measurements from a long firn record from Law Dome, Antarctica. The techniques are then applied to measurements of a range of halocarbons in a companion paper by Sturrock et al. [2002].

#   Abstract: Air samples extracted from Antarctic firn at Law Dome have been analyzed for the suite of halocarbons that contribute most of the anthropogenic chlorine and about half the anthropogenic bromine presently released into the stratosphere. The species, all included in the Montreal Protocol, are the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs -11, -12, -113, -114, -115), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs -22, -141b, -142b), halons (H -1211, -1301), CH3CCl3 (methyl chloroform) and CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride). The measurements were used to reconstruct the atmospheric history of these species since the 1930s, providing a record considerably predating existing in situ records or other conventional air archives, encompassing virtually the entire history of anthropogenic emissions of CFCs, HCFCs, and halons and giving early 20th century levels for CH3CCl3 and CCl4. Significant features of this study are (1) the narrow age spread (spectral width 5 years) of the individual firn air samples, which reveals rapid atmospheric changes, (2) the use of inversion techniques to infer past atmospheric composition with associated uncertainties, and (3) the low analytical detection limit (<0.1 ppt), which, together with the narrow air age spread, detects early background levels and resolves the time that industrial emissions first appeared in the southern hemisphere atmosphere. Integrity of the data is demonstrated by successful intercomparison of data from independent firn sites on Law Dome with common time-series. An upper limit is given for the potential contribution to atmospheric levels of CH3CCl3 from nonindustrial sources. The atmospheric records produced from firn air are compared to calculations based on the history of their global emissions.
